## Simple

### MVC

* enables good OO design
  example: the "model" simply contains the plant components, which are derived from a base Component class that the "controller" knows how to handle
* enables a modular design => software modules are interchangeable/extendable
  example: (class diagram here) adding a new `Component`
  example: (class diagram here) changing the "view"
